# School of Computer Programming and Analysis \(SCPA\)

## Hardware

What you need to be successful in the school of SCPA.

You will require:

### Windows Hardware

- A computer running **Windows** 10 \(or 11\). Recommended minimum specifications are:
  - RAM: 16GB
  - Processor: i5 processor \(i7 or M processor preferred\)
  - Storage: 512GB Solid State Drive \(SSD\) \(1TB preferred\)
  - Peripherals: Keyboard, mouse/trackpad, webcam, microphone

:::info Note

- **ARM-based** Windows machines are not recommended as the College VPN does not support ARM.
- Windows 10 is no longer available from Seneca. You are responsible for obtaining your own licensed operating system.
  :::

### Mac OSX Hardware

An Intel based Mac or MacBook is acceptable as it will support side-loading of Windows for some applications by implementing virtual machines. The specifications below take this into consideration.

- Recommended minimum specifications are:
  - RAM: 16GB
  - Processor: Quad-core processor \(any base quad core processors in MacBook Air, Pro 13/16" are acceptable\)
  - 512GB storage \(preferably an SSD\)
  - Peripherals: Keyboard, mouse/trackpad, webcam, microphone

:::info Note

- **You will have to run Windows on your Mac** in order to run the software required for your courses. Windows can be loaded a few different ways:
  _ **Bootcamp** (Intel processor only)
  _ **VMWare** (free) allows you to run Windows virtually
  _ **Parallels** (50% off for students)
  _ Parallels and Windows are available here for SDDS students: **https://senecapolytechnic.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx**
  _ A copy of Windows Education is available free for SDDS students.
  _ Apple offers bonus education discounts on the Air and 13‚Äù Pro about 6 weeks before and after the start of fall semester

### Internet

A high-speed internet connection is needed for online/hybrid courses, and requires a **minimum bandwidth of 25mb/sec down, and 2mb/sec up**, faster than that is better. The Canadian government has mandated that 50 down and 10 up should be the minimum required to call a connection high-speed.
